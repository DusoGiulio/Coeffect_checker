## **MiniJava Language Extension Project**
The extension introduces coefficients that allow control not only over the values associated with variables but also over the use of the variables themselves in the code.

## **Repository**
In the [source_code](./source_code) folder you'll find:
- The source code in the [src](./source_code/src) folder
- The documentation in the form of Javadoc in the [doc](./source_code/doc) folder
- The file specifying the MiniJava grammar, named [miniJava.g4](./source_code/miniJava.g4)

In the [executable_code](./executable_code) folder you'll find:
- The executable file [Coeffect_MiniJava.jar](./executable_code/Coeffect_MiniJava.jar)
- The necessary folders for the proper functioning of the JAR should be generated automatically during the JAR execution, containing the required files. In case this doesn't happen, they are available for download.

## **How to Use the Executable File**
1. Download the [executable_code](./executable_code) directory and open it.
2. Open the executable file [Coeffect_MiniJava.jar](./executable_code/Coeffect_MiniJava.jar):
   - Press the "Aggiungi File" button.
   - Select the .java or .txt files you want to analyze. **Attention, the first selected file must contain the main method.**
   - Press the "Avvia analisi" button.
   - The results will be displayed in the label below.

<span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>The project is an extension for a MiniJava language</strong>
>The extension consists of the introduction of coefficients that allow control not only over the values associated with the variables but also over the use of the variables themselves in the code.</span>

<span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>Repository</strong>
>In the <a href="./source_code">source_code</a> folder you'll find:
>- The source code in the <a href="./source_code/src">src</a> folder
>- The documentation in the form of Javadoc in the <a href="./source_code/doc">doc</a> folder
>- The file specifying the MiniJava grammar, named <a href="./source_code/miniJava.g4">miniJava.g4</a>.
> In the <a href="./executable_code">executable_code</a> folder you'll find:
>- The executable file <a href="./executable_code/Coeffect_MiniJava.jar">Coeffect_MiniJava.jar</a>
>- The necessary folders for the proper functioning of the JAR should be generated automatically during the JAR execution, containing the required files. In case this doesn't happen, they are available for download.
